        Now the two biggest players in the market—Rocket Lawyer and LegalZoom—are experimenting with blockchain smart contracts. 
        In theory, they could help automate real contracts and make some legal services easier and cheaper to use for everyone
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, LegalZoom, Rocket Lawyer’s biggest competitor, has begun working on smart contract technology in collaboration with a startup called Clause. 
        Another startup, called Monax, is testing a smart contract platform based on a private blockchain network and aimed at entrepreneurs and creative freelancers.
    </p>
    <p>Rocket Lawyer isn’t revealing many details yet, but it has launched a private beta phase for a program called Rocket Wallet, which it describes as a platform for “legal contract execution 
        and payment on the Ethereum blockchain.” To pull it off, it has also partnered with a blockchain startup called OpenLaw and the Ethereum-focused investment firm ConsenSys. It expects to have a product available to use later this year.</p>
